## Piantor UV 44
![Piantor UV 44](/Pictures/20240806.PIANTORUV44.00.png)
The Piantor UV 44 keyboard is a 44 key diodeless split keyboard with support for hotswap sockets, designed with simplicity in mind. Piantor UV 44 is a Piantor/Cantor fork with Raspberry Pi Pico, hybrid hotswap socket and soldered-in switches support and flippable PCB.
This is a WIP, you can follow the [Cantor's build guide](https://github.com/diepala/cantor/blob/main/doc/build_guide.md), as it is quite similar!

## Thanks
Big thanks to [@Excellenze11](https://github.com/Excellenze11) for ideas, cooperation and tests.

## Parts
As for the parts list, you will need:
- 2x PCB (The left and right half are the same)
- 44 Chocv1 Keys
- 44 Chocv1 Keycaps
- 44 Hotswap sockets for Chocv1 (optional)
- 2x TRRS jacks (PJ-320A)
- 2x RPi Pico and clones (RP2040). Warning. I don't have possibility to test ALL clones, so, please, have a look at the original Piantor's guide about the RPi Pico's clones before any purchase.

## Gerbers
You can find the Gerber files needed to order the PCB on the ![`Gerbers`](./Gerbers) directory. Look for the .zip of whatever version you would like!

## Attention
I'm a hobbyist/amateur at best. So there may be things that aren't optimized. So if you decide to use this, then please be advised that I'm not providing any sort of liability and you should exercise some caution. Use these file for your own risk. Thanks Sebastian Stumpf for this text.
